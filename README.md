# SteadyFlow

## C++ Implementation of [SteedyFlow](http://www.liushuaicheng.org/CVPR2014/).

This is a C++ implementation of the paper "SteadyFlow: Spatially Smooth Optical Flow for Video Stabilization".
This is ongoing project. I'm trying to reproduce SteadyFlow but It does not work well. Especially temporal analysis masks are not good.
## Note : It is not completed project.
